# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 11 January 2021 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to use Redux Toolkit with Redux and TypeScript.

**Thoughts**: The toolkit provides a much better dev experience when using React, Redux, and TypeScript together, especially in terms of seting up. I might keep using it for situations when the toolkit would do.

### Day 2: 12 January 2021 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to create my own Promise.

**Thoughts**: I was unable to use async/await with an async function that didn't return a Promise. When taking breaks and reading the docs, creating a Promise is suprisingly easy. Take more breaks!

### Day 3: 13 January 2021 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I worked on converting my work-in-progress Jira project from MERN to MERN + TypeScript + Redux + Jest + Enzyme.

**Thoughts**: I became stuck at trying to write a unit test for the `onChange` function of the input element. I'm glad that I stepped away from it because I definitely would not have been productive otherwise.

### Day 4: 14 January 2021 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned more on how to use mock functions and simulate user actions in Jest + Enzyme on a React + TS + Redux app.

**Thoughts**: React class components seem to be much easier to test than their function component counterparts. Is it because it's been around longer and support for function components isn't as readily available? In any case, I'm glad I know class components and can easily switch back and forth between the two.

### Day 5: 16 January 2021 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: I did a HackerRank challenges in the dictionaries and hashmaps category using Python.

**Thoughts**: While I'm not new to this problem pattern, I'm noticing that I'm getting just a little bit faster and better, whether it's from generating the algorithm for the solution, or remembering the necessary methods for given step.

### Day 6: 17 January 2021 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: I built a "Pomodoro timer" bash script with more bite.

**Thoughts**: I built this in order to help with my tendency to ignore the Pomodoro timers I set. The script automatically sends the computer to sleep after a variable number of minutes based on my input (e.g., `./sleep.sh 50`). I learned more about functions, function arguments, and sending processes to the background using "&".

### Day 7: 18 January 2021 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned client-side form validation using React and TypeScript.

**Thoughts**: I haven't done any sort of form validation before and forms in the real world typically have validation. Since Atlassian's Jira has it, I needed to learn it in order to incorporate it into my clone. I think I got the basics down, and I will most likely be implementing both client-side and server-side validation if not just the latter.

### Day 8: 20 January 2021 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I solved a [CodeSignal challenge](https://app.codesignal.com/interview-practice/task/5A8jwLGcEpTPyyjTB/description) on arrays using Python 3. The task is to rotate an image. The input is a 2D n x n array.

**Thoughts**: This challenged me a bit and reinforced that practicing will make me faster at doing code challenges. I especially felt frustrated when I felt that I was moving slow and I saw the one line solution of others. However, from what I know the top solutions do not fulfill the O(1) additional space requirement.

### Day 9: 21 January 2021 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I originally set out to recreate the Array.prototype.map method on JavaScript. I didn't feel challenged, so I recreated it on TypeScript.

**Thoughts**: I didn't know until now that there there was an `array` parameter in the callback function and a `thisArg` parameter in the map method. I still don't know when I would use these. I'm also not sure what `U` means. My guess is that it's a way to reference the return value of the callback function and assign `U[]` as the return value of the map method without having to use the `ReturnType<Type>` utility type.

### Day 10: 22 January 2021 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learned more about ECMAScript.

**Thoughts**: I became curious about ECMAScript (ES) and its relationship to JavaScript. There are different version of JavaScript and not all browsers are compatible with later versions of JavaScript. I also see the ES versions a lot when working with TypeScript. Simply put, JS is an ES dialect that conforms to the ES spec (called the ECMA-262).

### Day 11: 24 January 2021 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned about tmux + Neovim and tried to set up an IDE with it.

**Thoughts**: tmux + Neovim shows some promise, however, it is very hard to set up. Now, I'm appreciating VS Code more. While I may prefer using tmux + Neovim in the future, as a complete configuration enables you to have a much more efficient workflow without using the mouse, as of now I haven't replicated VS Code features on my tmux + Neovim environment.
