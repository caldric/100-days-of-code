# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 11 January 2021 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to use Redux Toolkit with Redux and TypeScript.

**Thoughts**: The toolkit provides a much better dev experience when using React, Redux, and TypeScript together, especially in terms of seting up. I might keep using it for situations when the toolkit would do.

### Day 2: 12 January 2021 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to create my own Promise.

**Thoughts**: I was unable to use async/await with an async function that didn't return a Promise. When taking breaks and reading the docs, creating a Promise is suprisingly easy. Take more breaks!

### Day 3: 13 January 2021 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I worked on converting my work-in-progress Jira project from MERN to MERN + TypeScript + Redux + Jest + Enzyme.

**Thoughts**: I became stuck at trying to write a unit test for the `onChange` function of the input element. I'm glad that I stepped away from it because I definitely would not have been productive otherwise.

### Day 4: 14 January 2021 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned more on how to use mock functions and simulate user actions in Jest + Enzyme on a React + TS + Redux app.

**Thoughts**: React class components seem to be much easier to test than their function component counterparts. Is it because it's been around longer and support for function components isn't as readily available? In any case, I'm glad I know class components and can easily switch back and forth between the two.

### Day 5: 16 January 2021 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: I did a HackerRank challenges in the dictionaries and hashmaps category using Python.

**Thoughts**: While I'm not new to this problem pattern, I'm noticing that I'm getting just a little bit faster and better, whether it's from generating the algorithm for the solution, or remembering the necessary methods for given step.

### Day 6: 17 January 2021 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: I built a "Pomodoro timer" bash script with more bite.

**Thoughts**: I built this in order to help with my tendency to ignore the Pomodoro timers I set. The script automatically sends the computer to sleep after a variable number of minutes based on my input (e.g., `./sleep.sh 50`). I learned more about functions, function arguments, and sending processes to the background using "&".
