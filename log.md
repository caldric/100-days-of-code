**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 11 January 2021 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to use Redux Toolkit with Redux and TypeScript.

**Thoughts**: The toolkit provides a much better dev experience when using React, Redux, and TypeScript together, especially in terms of seting up. I might keep using it for situations when the toolkit would do.
