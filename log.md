**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 11 January 2021 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to use Redux Toolkit with Redux and TypeScript.

**Thoughts**: The toolkit provides a much better dev experience when using React, Redux, and TypeScript together, especially in terms of seting up. I might keep using it for situations when the toolkit would do.

### Day 2: 12 January 2021 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to create my own Promise.

**Thoughts**: I was unable to use async/await with an async function that didn't return a Promise. When taking breaks and reading the docs, creating a Promise is suprisingly easy. Take more breaks!
